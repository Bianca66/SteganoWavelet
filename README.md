# SteganoWavelet
 
# Introduction
Internet applications are increased and growing at efficient way. Today, the internet makes the dissemination of information far easier than it's ever been before; it has become a major global data pipeline through which large amounts of intellectual property are moved. To protect the legal copyright of diverse forms of multimedia, many digital techniques can be used, one of these is steganography.  

The importance of steganography increased with the digitalization of the world. A general technique based on steganography consists in “hiding” the content inside an innocent-looking file. 

The application will apply hidden watermarks inside images. This will be done by applying the wavelet transform on the image, binarize the hidden watermark and introduce it in the picture. The proof that the algorithm works will be shown using the watermark extraction algorithm. 

The algorithm is parallelized using the mpi and simd paradigms.
 
# Objective
